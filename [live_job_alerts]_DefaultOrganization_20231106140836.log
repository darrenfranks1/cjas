Modality: "web application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the code is missing the necessary imports for the Flask and requests modules. To fix this, the following imports should be added to the main.py and job_search.py files:

In main.py:
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
```

In job_search.py:
```python
import requests
```

Please add these imports to the respective files to ensure that the code can run without any import errors."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the missing import statements in the main.py file. The JobSearch class from the job_search module needs to be imported in order to use it in the code. To fix this, add the following import statement at the top of the main.py file:

```python
from job_search import JobSearch
```

Once this import statement is added, the code should work as expected.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the missing import statements in the main.py file. The JobSearch class from the job_search module needs to be imported in order to use it in the code. To fix this, add the following import statement at the top of the main.py file:

```python
from job_search import JobSearch
```

Once this import statement is added, the code should work as expected."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the missing import statements in the main.py file. The JobSearch class from the job_search module needs to be imported in order to use it in the main.py file. To fix this, add the following import statement at the top of the main.py file:

```python
from job_search import JobSearch
```

Once this import statement is added, the JobSearch class can be used in the search() function in the main.py file.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the missing import statements in the main.py file. The JobSearch class from the job_search module needs to be imported in order to use it in the main.py file. To fix this, add the following import statement at the top of the main.py file:

```python
from job_search import JobSearch
```

Once this import statement is added, the JobSearch class can be used in the search() function in the main.py file."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file in the root directory of your project. Here's an example of how the requirements.txt file can be structured based on the provided codes:

requirements.txt

```
Flask==1.1.2
requests==2.25.1
```

In this example, we have included two dependencies: Flask and requests. Flask is a web framework used for building the web application, and requests is a library used for making HTTP requests to the job board APIs.

You can add more dependencies to the requirements.txt file if your project requires additional packages. Each package should be listed on a separate line, following the format `package_name==version_number` or `package_name>=minimum_version_number`.

Make sure to include the correct version numbers or version constraints for each package to ensure compatibility and stability. You can find the specific version numbers or version constraints by referring to the documentation of each package or by checking the versions used in your development environment.

Once you have created the requirements.txt file, you can use it to install the required packages by running the following command in your project's virtual environment:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install all the packages listed in the requirements.txt file, ensuring that your project has the necessary dependencies to run properly.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file in the root directory of your project. Here's an example of how the requirements.txt file can be structured based on the provided codes:
requirements.txt
```
Flask==1.1.2
requests==2.25.1
```
In this example, we have included two dependencies: Flask and requests. Flask is a web framework used for building the web application, and requests is a library used for making HTTP requests to the job board APIs.
You can add more dependencies to the requirements.txt file if your project requires additional packages. Each package should be listed on a separate line, following the format `package_name==version_number` or `package_name>=minimum_version_number`.
Make sure to include the correct version numbers or version constraints for each package to ensure compatibility and stability. You can find the specific version numbers or version constraints by referring to the documentation of each package or by checking the versions used in your development environment.
Once you have created the requirements.txt file, you can use it to install the required packages by running the following command in your project's virtual environment:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This command will install all the packages listed in the requirements.txt file, ensuring that your project has the necessary dependencies to run properly. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel. Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database   🤖 Agents   Documentation   End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha   📖 Documentation Please see here for full documentation on:   Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)   How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)   Reference (full API docs)   Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)   ``` |

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
